Company X has recently introduced a new type of bidding, average bidding, as an alternative to the current type of bidding called maximum bidding. 
One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and wants to do an A/B test to see if average bidding converts more than maximum bidding.
Purchase is the ultimate success criterion for Bombabomba.com.
